# demoutils

Utilities for demoing on sites like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [CodePen](http://codepen.io/pen/).

## Usage

Include the `demoutils.js` using [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/) or a similar service. This will define `demoutils` in your environment. See the source code for documentation on available methods.

There is an optional stylesheet, `demoutils.css`, which applies a pleasing Monokai theme.
